Stop Watch project
1. The stopwatch project is a web-based application created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
2. It features a user-friendly interface with three essential buttons: Start, Pause, and Restart.
3. The Start button initiates the stopwatch, allowing users to measure elapsed time accurately.
4. The Pause button enables users to temporarily halt the stopwatch and resume timing from the paused point.
5. The Restart button resets the stopwatch to its initial state, allowing users to start timing from zero again.
6. The project utilizes JavaScript's Date object to capture the current time and calculate the elapsed time.
7. The HTML and CSS components ensure an aesthetically pleasing and intuitive user interface.
8. The stopwatch's functionality is implemented using JavaScript event listeners to detect button clicks and perform corresponding actions.
9. The project employs JavaScript functions to control the stopwatch's behavior, making it modular and easy to maintain.
10. The stopwatch project demonstrates the power of front-end web development, combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a practical and interactive timing tool.
